(SP 800-63A)\n\nRemote proofing presents challenges to achieving the desired outcomes described above that can be overcome through the use specific processes and technologies. Potential processes and controls that CSPs may employ to mitigate risks associated with remote identity proofing at IAL2 include:\n\n1. A remote operator is present during at least part of the identity proofing session and can provide positive confirmation that the requirements for IAL2 identity proofing are met. Employing real-time remote operators provides the capability for the identity proofing process to be completed in a single session and allows the remote operator to direct the applicant for proper presentation and examination of identity evidence and biometrics collection.\n\n2. The CSP employs automated technologies and services (e.g., liveness detection, identity evidence verification and validation, and presentation attack detection, if applicable) which can ensure the requirements for IAL2 identity proofing are met and protect against spoofing attacks. This process also provides the capability for the identity proofing process to be completed in a single session.\n\n3. The CSP employs an off-line operator to evaluate the evidence and images collected during a previous identity proofing process. In this scenario, the identity proofing process requires more than one session with the applicant and is not completed until the operator provides a positive confirmation that all requirements for IAL2 identity proofing are met."

Documenting the types and strengths of evidence the CSP collects for each proofing encounter demonstrates conformance for this requirement. (Also see GEN-8b.)\n\nExamples of methods and how they can be used to capture identity evidence images or extract data for validation include:\n\n● Cameras to capture an images of identity evidence for the purposes of evidence validation;\n\n● Document scanner to capture images of identity evidence for the purpose of evidence validation; and\n\n● Bar-code scanner to capture and extract information from standardized barcodes embedded on identity evidence.\n\nHigh resolution images of at least 300 ppi are necessary for proper evidence examination and validation."

Identity validation is made up of three process steps: 1) collect the appropriate identity evidence, 2) confirm the evidence is genuine and authentic, and 3) confirm the data contained on the identity evidence is valid, current, and related to a real-life subject. (5.2)\n\nEvidence validation for authenticity involves examining the evidence for:\n\n* Confirmation of required information completeness and format for the identity evidence type.\n* Detection of evidence tampering or the creation of counterfeit or fraudulent evidence.\n* Confirmation of security features. See Appendix C to this document for types of commonly used security features for identity evidence.\n\n\nMost of the capabilities to confirm security features on identity evidence are dependent upon physically viewing the evidence directly, tactile feel of the evidence, and viewing the evidence under specialized lighting or through the use of specialized equipment (see Appendix C). Therefore, the validation of evidence that may be submitted remotely for remote identity proofing methods is particularly challenging. For this reason, CSPs opting to provide remote identity proofing may find it most effective to use automated evidence validation products and services. If automated evidence validation solutions are not used, CSPs may choose to apply similar procedures for IAL2 remote proofing as are required for IAL3 supervised remote proofing. These procedures provide that a trained operator can remotely supervise the evidence collection process, require the applicant to turn or tilt evidence or apply lighting to be able to confirm security features on evidence that is presented for the identity proofing encounter in a recorded video or webcast. Alternatively, a CSP may use an automated interface for the capture of identity evidence images that similarly can direct the applicant to turn, tilt or provide lighting on evidence presented for identity proofing purposes.\n\nThe next step in identity evidence validation for authenticity and integrity is to verify the correctness of information from the identity evidence against the issuing source for the evidence or an authoritative source that has linkage to the issuing source. Results of these checks for authenticity and integrity should be recorded.\n\nTable 5-2 in NIST SP 800-63A lists strengths, ranging from unacceptable to superior, of identity validation performed by the CSP to validate the evidence presented for the current proofing session and the information contained therein."

This comparison can be an in-person comparison for in-person identity proofing processes or may be conducted remotely for remote identity proofing. In both cases, the operator must perform a physical comparison of the applicant to the facial image photograph on the evidence. That is, the in-person proofing personnel will physically compare the facial image of the live applicant to the facial image photograph on the strongest piece of validated evidence. For remote physical comparison, the applicants\u2019 facial image may be captured by high resolution video or camera for physical comparison to the facial image photograph on the identity evidence.\n\nFor identity proofing verification, biometric comparison is an automated comparison of a biometric characteristic recorded on the strongest piece of identity evidence compared to the corresponding biometric characteristic of the applicant captured live during the identity proofing session\n\nRemote identity proofing requires the collection of both an image of the identity evidence and a live capture of the facial image of the applicant for physical or biometric comparison. The CSP must employ liveness and presentation attack detection capabilities to ensure that the applicant\u2019s facial image or other biometric characteristic used for comparison is \u201clive\u201d and not a spoofing or presentation attack. Potential methods for remote identity proofing processes to mitigate such spoofing and presentation attacks are presented below.\n\n● A remote operator is present during the identity proofing session (similar to supervised remote in-person proofing) and can conduct a real-time physical comparison between an image of the identity evidence and a live video of the applicant. In order to confirm the video stream is live and not pre-recorded, the Operator could direct the applicant to move their head in specific ways, or even ask the applicant a question. Once a positive confirmation is recorded from the operator, and all other requirements are met, the identity proofing can be completed in a single session.\n\n● The CSP employs automated capabilities which are specifically designed to compare the image of the identity evidence with the applicant, and which also employ liveness detection technologies. Pending a positive confirmation from the automated comparison, and the satisfaction of all other requirements, the identity proofing can be completed in a single session.\n\n● The CSP employs liveness detection technology during the capture of the facial image, and an off-line operator performs the physical comparison of images captured during the identity proofing session. The identity proofing process requires more than one session with the applicant and is not completed until the operator provides a positive confirmation of the comparison and the other requirements are met."

These controls are the operational, technical, and management safeguards to maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and security of federal information systems and are intended to be used in conjunction with the NIST risk management framework outlined in SP 800-37 and SP 800-63-3 section 5, Digital Identity Risk Management. NIST SP 800-53 presents security control baselines determined by the security categorization of the information system (low, moderate or high) from NIST FIPS 199 Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. For IAL2, the moderate baseline controls (see https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/impact/moderate) may be considered the starting point for the selection, enhancement, and tailoring of the security controls presented. Guidance on tailoring the control baselines to best meet the organization\u2019s risk environment, systems and operations is presented in SP 800-53 section 3.2. Tailoring Baseline Security Controls.\n\nWhile SP 800-53 and other NIST Special Publications in the SP-800-XXX series apply to federal agencies for the implementation of the Federal information Security Modernization (Management) Act (FISMA), non-federal entities providing services for federal information systems may also need to demonstrate appropriate controls and should similarly use SP 800-53 and associated publications as resources. Non-federal entities may be subject to and conformant with other applicable controls systems and processes for information system security (e.g., FEDRAMP, ISO/IEC 27001). SP800-63A allows the application of equivalent controls from such standards and processes to meet conformance with this criterion."

The strongest piece of evidence for IAL3 must be at the SUPERIOR level. Therefore, the linkage of the applicant to the evidence must be verified at the SUPERIOR level. For IAL3, this linkage is achieved through a biometric comparison of the facial image (i.e., photograph) or other biometric modality on the strongest piece of evidence to a corresponding biometric characteristic captured live from the applicant during the in-person proofing session. IAL3 identity verification methods are shown in the table below.\n\nA physical comparison is a comparison by a person (i.e., CSP trained operator) of the applicant to a photograph (i.e., facial image) from the strongest identity evidence collected. The operator performs a physical comparison of the in-person applicant to the photograph on the evidence.\n\nA biometric comparison is an automated comparison of biometric modalities present on the strongest piece of identity evidence to corresponding biometric modalities of the applicant captured during the identity proofing session.\n\nIdentity verification is performed against the strongest piece of identity evidence submitted and validated. For IAL3 the strongest piece of evidence will always be either STRONG or SUPERIOR evidence. KBV (sometimes referred to as knowledge-based authentication) is only permitted as a verification method for evidence at the FAIR strength level; therefore, verification of FAIR evidence binding will never be required for IAL3"

NIST SP 800-53 presents security control baselines determined by the security categorization of the information system (low, moderate or high) from NIST FIPS 199 Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. For IAL3 the high baseline controls (see https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/impact/high) may be considered the starting point for the selection, enhancement, and tailoring of the security controls presented. Guidance on tailoring the control baselines to best meet the organization\u2019s risk environment, systems and operations is presented in SP 800-53 section 3.2. Tailoring Baseline Security Controls.\n\nWhile SP 800-53 and other NIST Special Publications in the SP-800-XXX series apply to federal agencies for the implementation of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA), non-federal entities providing services for federal information services also are subject to FISMA and should similarly use SP 800-53 and associated publications for appropriate controls. Non-federal entities may be subject to and conformant with other applicable controls systems and processes for information system security (e.g., FEDRAMP, ISO/IEC 27001).

The goal of this arrangement is to permit identity proofing of individuals in remote locations where it is not practical for them to travel to the CSP for in-person identity proofing.\n\nThe purpose of supervised remote identity proofing is to take advantage of improvements in sensor technology (cameras and biometric sensors) and communications bandwidth to closely duplicate the security of in-person identity proofing, which has been the requirement for high-assurance identity proofing in the past. This can be done through the use of a remote identity proofing station (or kiosk) which is under the control of the CSP or a third party that is trusted by the CSP to maintain its integrity.\n\nSupervised remote identity proofing may also be used for achieving comparability with in-person requirements when face-to-face (i.e., in-person) encounters may present health risks to the applicant, CSP personnel or both. This circumstance may occur due to circumstances such as the covid-19 pandemic where face-to-face encounters may present health risks. In such circumstance supervised remote identity proofing may be used in a common facility where the applicant and CSP are in different locations in the facility but not actually interacting face-to-face. In such circumstances supervised remote identity proofing processing may be used.\n\nIt is intended that CSPs employing supervised remote identity proofing will document the procedures, equipment, and controls for supervised remote proofing in an applicable written policy or \\*practice statement\\* as described in SP 800-63A conformance criterion GEN-6."

These controls are the operational, technical, and management safeguards to maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and security of federal information systems and are intended to be used in conjunction with the NIST risk management framework outlined in SP 800-37 and SP 800-63-3 section 5 Digital Identity Risk Management. NIST SP 800-53 presents security control baselines determined by the security categorization of the information system (low, moderate or high) from NIST FIPS 199 Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. For IAL2, the moderate baseline controls (see https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/impact/moderate) may be considered the starting point for the selection, enhancement, and tailoring of the security controls presented. Guidance on tailoring the control baselines to best meet the organization\u2019s risk environment, systems and operations is presented in SP 800-53 section 3.2. Tailoring Baseline Security Controls.\n\nWhile SP 800-53 and other NIST Special Publications in the SP-800-XXX series apply to federal agencies for the implementation of the Federal information Security Management Act (FISMA), non-federal entities providing services for federal information services also are subject to FISMA and should similarly use SP 800-53 and associated publications for appropriate controls. Non-federal entities may be subject to and conformant with other applicable controls systems and processes for information system security (e.g., FEDRAMP, ISO/IEC 27001. SP-63A allows the application of equivalent controls from such standards and processes to meet conformance with this criterion."

These controls are the operational, technical, and management safeguards to maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and security of federal information systems and are intended to be used in conjunction with the NIST risk management framework outlined in SP 800-37 and SP 800-63-3 section 5 Digital Identity Risk Management. NIST SP 800-53 presents security control baselines determined by the security categorization of the information system (low, moderate or high) from NIST FIPS 199 Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. For IAL3 the high baseline controls (see https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/impact/high) may be considered the starting point for the selection, enhancement, and tailoring of the security controls presented. Guidance on tailoring the control baselines to best meet the organization\u2019s risk environment, systems and operations is presented in SP 800-53 section 3.2, Tailoring Baseline Security Controls.\n\nWhile SP 800-53 and other NIST Special Publications in the SP-800-XXX series apply to federal agencies for the implementation of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA), non-federal entities providing services for federal information services also are subject to FISMA and should similarly use SP 800-53 and associated publications for appropriate controls. Non-federal entities may be subject to and conformant with other applicable controls systems and processes for information system security (e.g., FEDRAMP, ISO/IEC 27001). SP 800-63B allows the application of equivalent controls from such standards and processes to meet conformance with this criterion."
