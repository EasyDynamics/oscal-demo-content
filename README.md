# OSCAL Content

Directory containing example OSCAL files.

## Purpose

The oscal-content directory exists to provide example OSCAL files to
be used as content for the REST service. It provides the expected
directory structure for the files, with one directory each for
Catalogs, Components, Profiles, and System Security Plans.

The files in this directory are also used to test and validate different
aspects of the REST service.

## Source

The OSCAL files are based on those from the
[Easy Dynamics fork](https://github.com/EasyDynamics/oscal-content) of the
[NIST OSCAL Content](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-content) repository.

Additional customizations have been added to support demonstrations and to
highlight features of the
[OSCAL React Library](https://github.com/EasyDynamics/oscal-react-library).
